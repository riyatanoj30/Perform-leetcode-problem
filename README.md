The goal of this repo is to:
- Strengthen my SQL problem-solving skills
- Build a reference base for future SQL interviews
- Help others learn by example

## 🚀 How to Use

If you're learning SQL, feel free to:
- Browse through problem folders
- Read the SQL solution from screenshots
- Try solving it yourself first before peeking at the solution
- Copy SQL and run on your own MySQL/PostgreSQL setup or on LeetCode itself

---

## 💡 Tips for SQL Practice

- Read the problem carefully — especially what needs to be returned.
- Use `JOIN`s when working across multiple tables.
- Aggregate wisely using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
- Pay attention to **edge cases** and **NULL** values.
- Write clean and readable SQL — it's not just about correctness, but also clarity.
